## Project Purpose

The application's purpose is to display clothing posts from users based on the daily forecast, which is determined by an API call to the website [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

When the temperature is low, the main page will display clothing suitable for cold weather, and vice versa. Users can log in, create a clothing post, and select the weather type. The post will be displayed on the main page based on the forecast.

Users have a variety of ways to interact with the application, they can:

1. Change the temperature to Fahrenheit or Celcius
1. Sign-up
1. Log-In
1. Like Clothing Posts
1. Navigate to the Main page by clicking the WTWR logo
1. Navigate to a Profile page by clicking their Proifle Image
1. Add a Clothing Post and determine its weather type
1. Delete your own Clothing Post
1. Edit their Profile name and image
1. Log out of their Profile

Here is a [old version of the application](https://Freddy-PC.github.io/se_project_react) that was deployed via GitHub pages.

I followed this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/DTojSwldenF9UPKQZd6RRb/Sprint-10%3A-WTWR) to create the Front-End.

## Part 2/2: The Back-End

The functionality that allows users to interact with the application on the World Wide Web could not be possible without a Back-End.
You can access the Back-End Repo by [Clicking Here](https://github.com/Freddy-PC/se_project_express)!
